# file2c
Convert a file to C variable &amp; more

## Overview
File2c is a simple, but very fast tool for including files to C programs. Have you ever wondered about having a ZIP file with
additional data attached to your program and placed in `/usr/share`? If you would do this, someone might have forgotten placing
the file in data folder, and gets angry of your program not working. Then you use this. You should call:

	`file2c -f myfile.zip -o myfile.zip.c -j`

Without the -j option, your C code would be GCC dependent. Now it should work on any C99 (and mostly and C89) supporting
compiler.

## Invocation
These options can be passed on command line:
 + `-j` - Use Java/C89 style escapes only
 + `-J` - Enables `-j`, generate Java-style declaration rather than C-style one
 + `-h` `--help` - Print help text
 + `-V` `--version` - Print version of this program
 + `-v` `--variable` - Needs to have an argument, name of variable in code generated
 + `-f` `--file` - Specify an input file, needs to have an argument, **REQUIRED**
 + `-o` `--output` - Change output from default (`file2c.out`), needs to have an argument

## GPLv3 compliance
This program makes one exception from GPLv3 - any output file generated by file2c is **copyright person who run this program**.
Any file contents included in generated file **may be subject of copyright of copyright owner of input file**. This tool does
not break copyrights without users' action.
